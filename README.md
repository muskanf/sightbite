This model is for our project for Microsoft Imagine Cup 2024. Our MVP is that our app can detect the progress of the food and alert the user.
There is a folder called testdata with _ pictures of food. Upload a picture in the tensormodel.py file to check the results.
This model might still be inaccurate as it's still in training, so please be aware. We are working hard on making sure that we can train it as much as possible on ethical and unbiased data.

HOW TO USE IT:
1- Cook some food, or burn some food. Order some food. Then, take a picture!
2- Put that image in TestData
3- Rename your picture as myfooditem
4- Go to tensormodel.py 
5- Go to line 72
6- Replace fries.jpg with your file name
7- Hit run!
